## Job market paper
***Child Disability, Family Labor Supply, and the Value of the SSI Program***
Approximately 7\% of children in the US have a disability, broadly defined as an activity limiting mental, physical or emotional health condition. Such a condition may confer medical eligibility for transfers from the Child Supplemental Security Income program (SSI). If a child with a disability requires additional expenditures of time or money then child SSI may be highly valued by recipients and improve welfare. However, social insurance programs also generate costs -- both the direct cost of the benefits and the behavioral distortions generated by the program. This project employs a life cycle model to quantify the welfare benefits and costs of child SSI. My current estimates indicate that the insurance value provided by the current program is sizeable, with most women in my sample being willing to pay more than the actuarially fair price for additional insurance. I also use the model to compute the excess burden generated by the programâ€™s income and asset tests, and assess the potential welfare gains from a variety of recently-proposed program reforms.
